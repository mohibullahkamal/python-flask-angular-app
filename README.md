A simple Web App build using Python, Flask, Angular.


Quick Steps for you to run the app in your machine(in terminal):

1. ```docker --version``` --> Check if you have docker installed; if NOT, please download, and install it.
2. ``` git clone https://github.com/mohibullahkamal/python-flask-angular-app.git``` --> Clone the app
3. ```cd <Enter your path here>``` --> cd into the cloned folder
4. ```docker-compose build``` --> use docker-compose to build container of our whole App
5. ```docker-compose up --build``` --> start the container you just created in step-4; the --build tag checks if you have changed something in the project.
6. AWESOME!!! Go to your browser and type "localhost" to see the running app --> ```localhost```
7. ```docker-compose down``` --> Finally; to remove all the containers from your system.
